# Spring Framework 5 Implementation
Implementation of course I am doing to learn Spring Framework 5 and all the it entails.

Rather than creating several repos for every small project of this course, I opted to use folders within the main repo. 
It's maybe not as clean, but I prefer to have everything collected one place (knowing GitHub probably allows for something more clever).
